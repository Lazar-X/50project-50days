# dad-jokes
Today I worked on a project called Dad Jokes, which is a responsive webpage. The HTML and CSS were simple, consisting of a container and a button with an event listener. 

However, the main focus of the project was on using APIs. To get the jokes, I used the fetch API to retrieve a JSON file from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/. 

I also learned about using async/await functions, which made handling the API data much easier. Overall, it was a great learning experience and I'm excited to use my new knowledge in future projects.
