# movie-app
In Movie App, I used the themoviedb API to fetch movie information. Firstly, I created the basic HTML structure and added some CSS styling for the page layout. Then, in the JavaScript code, I defined the API information I needed for the project.

To fetch movies, I created a function that made an API call and printed the movie data to the HTML page. Additionally, I added a small function to display movie ratings with red, green or orange colors, depending on the rating.

To enhance user experience, I also added an input field for search functionality, so that users can search for their desired movies. When someone searches for a movie, the page refreshes with new movies that contain the search term.

Overall, I am really happy with how the Movie App turned out. It was a fun and engaging project that allowed me to practice my API fetching and DOM manipulation skills.
