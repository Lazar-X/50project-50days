The Hidden Search Widget is a simple, fully responsive project that features a search bar with a hidden twist. The search bar consists of an input field and a button field, where the button initially covers the input field. When the user clicks on the button, the search bar expands to reveal the full input field and moves the button to the right.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML code includes a container that holds the input and button fields, while the CSS code styles the search bar with a sleek design. The JavaScript code listens for a click event on the button, which triggers the addition of an "active" class to the container, revealing the full input field and moving the button to the right.

Overall, the Hidden Search Widget is a great project to practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, and provides a simple and effective way to enhance your website's search functionality.
