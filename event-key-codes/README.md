# event-key-codes
I completed a project called "Event Key Codes". It's a responsive project with a simple HTML structure and basic CSS styling. In the JavaScript code, I added an event listener for the "keydown" event and accessed the properties for the key name and key code. Then, I printed them dynamically to the HTML using template literals.

It's a really simple project, but it's a great example of how to capture user input and access key properties in JavaScript. Overall, it was a fun and easy project to work on!
