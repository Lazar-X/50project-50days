# scroll-animation
The Scroll Animation project is a simple but visually appealing project that can be used for various websites. The project is fully responsive but has some issues with the horizontal bar, which was fixed with the addition of overflow-x: hidden property. In the HTML, there are multiple divs with the class box, which can hold any content that is desired. The CSS styling is where the magic happens, with the initial state of translateX set to 400%, and every second, it is changed to -400%. Additionally, there is a class called show which sets the translateX to 0 (default). In the JavaScript, there is an event listener for scroll, and a function that calculates the trigger bottom and the box top. If the box top is less than the trigger bottom, the class show is added, and if not, it is removed. This project is a great way to add a simple but cool animation to any website.
