# rotating-navigation
The Rotating Navigation project is a fully responsive website navigation system that works seamlessly on various devices, including mobile devices. With JavaScript event listeners, the project dynamically adds or removes classes to initiate the rotation of the page.

The project's main feature is its use of CSS to move elements in and out of the user's view using smooth transitions. When the navbar button is clicked, the page container rotates, and the navbar appears from the left side. The rotation effect is achieved through the use of translate properties, which are applied to the elements based on the added or removed classes.

Overall, the Rotating Navigation project is an excellent example of creative and efficient website navigation design, and it can be customized to suit a variety of website styles and themes.
