# animated-navigation
The project is called Animated Navigation, and it's a responsive project. In the HTML file, I have a simple list of links and a button with two divs that will act as the lines for the menu icon. In the CSS file, I spent most of my time styling everything to make it look visually appealing.

The logic behind the navigation is pretty straightforward. When we add the "active" class to the navigation, the list of links will appear. When we remove the "active" class, the list will disappear. This is done using an event listener that will toggle the "active" class when the user clicks on the menu icon.

Overall, the project was a fun exercise in using CSS to create visually appealing designs and using JavaScript to add interactivity to the page.
