# theme-clock
I created a project called Theme Clock, which is a responsive website that displays the time and date in a visually appealing way. In the HTML, I included a button to toggle between light and dark modes, a clock container, and elements to display the current time and date. In the CSS, I added styling to make the clock look modern and sleek, including using the transform property to rotate the clock hands.

In the JavaScript, I added an event listener to the button to toggle between light and dark modes. I also created a function called setTime, which is called every second to update the current time and date displayed on the clock. To rotate the clock hands, I used a function called scale() from StackOverflow to calculate the rotation degrees for the hour, minute, and second hands.

Overall, this was a really cool project and I'm really happy with how the dark mode looks.
