# faq-collapse
For the FAQ Collapse project, I created a responsive design. In the HTML, I created a container to hold multiple divs, each representing a question and its answer. To make the design visually appealing, I used CSS to add basic styling and icons that users can click to expand or collapse the answer. I also learned how to add icons using CSS with selectors like :after and :before and the content property.

In the JavaScript code, I added an event listener for a click event that toggles the active class, which displays or hides the answer when clicked. It's a simple yet useful project that can enhance the user experience on websites with frequently asked questions.
